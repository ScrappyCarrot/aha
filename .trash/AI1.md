. Regulatory Context and Classification

The structure's operation within the area covered by the Eindhoven Internationale **Knoop XL** project requires adherence to the **Environment Buildings Decree (Bbl)**, particularly concerning temporary status and relocation.

A. Temporary Structure Classification

A "temporary structure" is defined as a structure with a maintenance period of **no more than 15 years** at the same location, making your 3-year plan compliant with this definition.

• **General Rules:** The rules of **Chapter 3 (Existing Structures)** generally apply to the construction of a temporary structure, unless otherwise specified in Sections 4.2 to 4.7 (New Constructions),. The underlying assumption for structural and health requirements is that satisfying the rules for existing structures (Sections 3.2 to 3.7) is sufficient.

• **Specific Requirements (Chapter 4):** Key rules from Chapter 4 that specifically apply to temporary structures include provisions related to:

    ◦ **Escape Routes and Fire Assistance:** Articles 4.65 to 4.71 (course of escape routes) and Articles 4.84 and 4.85 (fire brigade lift/aid post) apply.

    ◦ **Ventilation and Flue Gas:** The requirements for ventilation/flushing facility capacity (Articles 4.131 and 4.132) and rules regarding flue gas discharge/combustion air supply (Articles 4.135 to 4.141) apply.

    ◦ **Sustainability (Thermal):** Articles 4.152 (thermal resistance), 4.153 (heat transfer coefficient), and 4.154 (air volume flow) apply, generally setting the minimum requirements at values specified in Table 4.148B,.

B. Relocation Regulations

The relocation of a temporary structure is considered the displacement of an existing structure,.

• **Rules for Displacement:** When relocating an existing structure in an **unchanged composition**, the structure must comply with the rules of **Chapter 3 (Existing Structures)**,. For a temporary structure, this rule remains applicable after relocation,.
